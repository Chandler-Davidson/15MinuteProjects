# RobertHeatonProjects
This repo is a way to host my quick attempts at [Robert Heaton's Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/20/project-2-game-of-life/), a collection of quick programming exercises and related instruction. Additionally to solving the challenges, I kept detailed notes as comments within the source. Each part of the article is broken up into different files. These projects were a great way for me to freshen up on Javascript using Node.
