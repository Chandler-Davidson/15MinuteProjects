# Elitist Fizz Buzz
## Purpose
The fizzbuzz program that proves you're right. Not just technically right, but practically too!

## Solutions
For each solution, I tried to provide a unique solution that have varying amounts of success.
Results are printed as miliseconds elapsed from the start of the function.
Thanks to [Jeff Sheets](https://github.com/jeffsheets) for providing the ugliest version of fizzbuzz.
