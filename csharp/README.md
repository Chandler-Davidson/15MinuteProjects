### Elitist Fizz Buzz

### Predictive Text
#### Purpose
Completed for an online programming challenge, thought it was a unique solution to an everyday problem.

### Trying Tries
#### Purpose
A review of Data Structures by building a Trie.
#### Continuation
The majority of the collections are implemented as List and manipulated using Linq. The more common solution
was to implement using arrays declared to the size of the alphabet. It would be interesting to see the comparison
of extremes time vs memory.
