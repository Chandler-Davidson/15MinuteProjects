# Text Editor
## Purpose
Simple text editor with line numbers. An easy project to add more features to and reskin in the future.

## Todo
Ease loading of line numbers. Currently, loads every possible line. It should only load those that are visible.
Add find/find and replace functions
Basic syntax highlights for a less verbose language, maybe lua.
