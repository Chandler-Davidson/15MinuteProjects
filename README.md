# 15MinuteProjects
Short projects to keep the dev juices flowin'.

The repo is split into JS and C#. The JS directory is a collection of challenges from [Robert Heaton](https://robertheaton.com/). The C# directory is a collection of various projects I found interesting.

## Elitist Fizz Buzz
### Purpose
The fizzbuzz program that proves you're right. Not just technically right, but practically too!
### Solutions
For each solution, I tried to provide a unique solution that have varying amounts of success.

## Predictive Text
### Purpose
Completed for an online programming challenge, thought it was a unique solution to an everyday problem.

## Trying Tries
### Purpose
A review of Data Structures by building a Trie.
### Continuation
The majority of the collections are implemented as List and manipulated using Linq. The more common solution
was to implement using arrays declared to the size of the alphabet. It would be interesting to see the comparison
of extremes time vs memory.
